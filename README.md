## Introduction:

<p align="center">
As a team, we decided to develop something that might be technically interesting and a bit challenging, <br>
so we clearly chose to work on something we've never done before: a <strong>quiz game</strong>. <br> 
This project was created coding mainly in <strong>React + Vite</strong> and <strong>SASS</strong>, <br>
we also used <strong>Firebase</strong> to store user scores and <strong>Vercel</strong> to deploy it. <br>
Some of the graphic elements were designed using <strong>Canva</strong>. <br>
We planned it starting from <strong>mobile first</strong> and then making it <strong>responsive</strong> for tablet and desktop. <br>
Moreover, we tried to take into account what a user can expect from a single-player game <br>
to offer a better <strong>user experience</strong>.
</p>

## Deep dive:

</p>

<p align="left">
On the main page the user can select a <strong>leaderboard</strong>, <br>
to take a look at the players who have already taken part in the quiz and have obtained the best scores. <br>
Below the leaderboard, it's possible to pick an <strong>avatar</strong> and type a <strong>nickname</strong>, <br>
to create a personal profile and then proceed to <strong>Login</strong>.

</p>

<p align="left">
Once logged in, the user will see the <strong>game page</strong>, where the player has multiple choice questions available. <br>
The quiz consists of <strong>three difficulty levels</strong>, which correspond to three rounds of a match: <br>
<strong>easy</strong>, <strong>medium</strong> and <strong>hard</strong>. <br>
Each correct question will earn the player 1 point, while each incorrect question will earn no points. <br>
Each round has a maximum duration of <strong>60 seconds</strong>, <br>
which is indicated by a bar that marks the passage of time and changes color when time is running out, <br>
so the user has to be careful and very quick to read both the question and the answers <br>
and try to select the exact answer. <br>
Each time a correct answer is given, it will be possible to see the <strong>count of points</strong> earned right on the screen. <br>
Within this page there are, at the top, also two options to return to the Homepage or refresh the current game page.

At the end of the three rounds, the <strong>total score</strong> of the match will be shown on the screen <br>
and the user also has the option to return to the Homepage or take a look at the <strong>Leaderboard</strong> <br>
to see if the score was enough to compete with the best players.
